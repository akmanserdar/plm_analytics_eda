## Description
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Change Requests (CR) approval processes in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The goal of this analysis is to get insights and patterns in the data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the approval process.

## EDA Insights
# Distribution of Approval Days
The analysis revealed that most change requests are approved within a certain range, with a few outliers experiencing significantly longer approval times.  
# Frequency of Change Types
Minor changes are the most frequent, indicating that most change requests are relatively simple.  

# Department Workload
The Engineering and Quality departments handle the majority of change requests, suggesting a potential need for resource allocation to manage workloads.  

# User Requests
Certain users submit more change requests than others, indicating areas where additional support or training might be beneficial.  

# Relationship Between Complexity and Approval Days
A positive correlation exists between the complexity of a change request and the time taken for approval, highlighting the impact of request complexity on the approval process.  

# Correlation Between Variables
The correlation analysis shows significant positive correlation between Complexity and Approval_Days, suggesting that simplifying complex requests could lead to faster approvals.

## Visualizations
The repository includes various visualizations to support the insights gained from the EDA:

**Histograms and KDE Plots:** Show the distribution of Approval_Days.
**Boxplots:** Highlight outliers and the spread of Approval_Days.
**Count Plots:** Display the frequency of Change_Type, Department, and Requested_By.
**Scatter Plots:** Illustrate the relationship between Complexity and Approval_Days.
**Heatmaps:** Show correlations between numerical variables.
**Violin Plots:** Provide a detailed view of the distribution of Complexity by Change_Type.

## Conclusion
The EDA provides valuable insights into the *PLM Analytics* process, identifying areas for potential improvement and efficiency gains. By understanding the patterns and relationships within the data, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize the approval workflow
